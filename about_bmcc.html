    <p class="paboutbmcc">Bay Mills Community College (BMCC) is located on the southeastern shore of Lake Superior within 
      the Bay Mills Indian Community (BMIC) approximately 17 miles west of Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
      As Michigan’s first fully accredited, tribally controlled college, BMCC meets the educational needs of a wide variety of students 
      through its remote, rural Main Campus, West Campus, Waishkey Bay Farm site, off-campus sites, and online courses. Control is vested 
      in a Board of Regents, which elects the officers of the Board and establishes overall institutional policy. BMCC is accredited by the 
      Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium.</p>

      <p class="paboutbmcc"> BMCC is one of three tribally controlled colleges in the State of Michigan and the only community college in Michigan’s Eastern Upper Peninsula. 
      It is committed to providing affordable, culturally relevant, accessible, and high quality educational opportunities to all tribal communities in
      Michigan and their neighbors. BMCC is also committed to providing leadership in the areas of economic and community development for the Bay Mills 
      Indian Community and the Eastern Upper Peninsula (EUP). As a 1994 Land Grant Institution, BMCC works closely with land grant partners, such as Michigan
      State University to provide service and expertise to the Bay Mills Indian Community and the surrounding region. </p>
        
      <h1 class="h1green">Accreditation</h1>
      <p class="paboutbmcc">Bay Mills Community College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).  HLC is an independent corporation that was founded in 1895 as 
        one of six regional institutional accreditors in the United States.  In 2017, Bay Mills Community College’s accreditation was reviewed and this resulted in a recommendation

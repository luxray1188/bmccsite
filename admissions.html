     who are eligible to enroll in postsecondary institutions. This program provides an opportunity for high school students to earn college credit while still attending high school. 
     Students who would like to pursue dual enrollment must check with their high school principal or guidance counselor for eligibility guidelines and dual enrollment information. 
     Dual enrollment forms and information can be found here.</p>
<p class="admissionp">*If you applied to BMCC but did not attend, we typically retain official copies of transcripts for two academic years. If we have official transcripts on file, students
    will not need to request new copies.  Please contact the Admissions Office if you believe we have your transcripts or if you have any questions at 906 248-3354.</p>
